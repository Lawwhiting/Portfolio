    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Lawrence and I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp to polish my programming knowledge. I have spent
    over 10 years working in the private banking sector as an asset manager. I was fortunate to work in Switzerland, Canada, and France as a financial research analyst. This lead to an interest for
    machine learnging and software development as an answer to better asses data and predict succesful outcomes when investing. More importanly, life is short and I have spent roughly 35 years of my life traveling the  and working with different industries and cultures. I enjoy every day as a new oppurutnity</p>
